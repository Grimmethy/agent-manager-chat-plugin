# Architecture Review Candidates

### AC-1 · Header comment overstates Phase-3 scope; `queue_dir`/`instances_dir` usage unverified
Strength: Worth exploring
Files: app.py

Problem:
The module header in `app.py` states that Phase 3 (2026-09-15) "migrated all queue/instance/roots logic to `internal_api_client.py`" and that this repo "no longer reads/writes `instances//queue/`." Yet `app.py` still defines `queue_dir()` and `instances_dir()`. If those two functions are genuinely uncalled after the migration, they are residual code that contradicts the header's blanket claim. However, the shared infrastructure they rely on—`_active_project_setting()`, `ENV_FILE_PATH`, `CORE_REPO_ROOT`—is also used by live code paths: `get_second_brain_dir()` calls `_active_project_setting("SECOND_BRAIN_DIR")`, and `CORE_REPO_ROOT` feeds `ENV_FILE_PATH` → `read_env_file` / `read_dashboard_settings` → `claude_defaults` → `_discuss_provider_args`, as well as `claude_client.py` and `model_stats_client.py`. A blanket removal of "the associated env-file reading logic" would break those live paths.

Solution:
1. Grep for call sites of `queue_dir` and `instances_dir` across the repo (including `routes/`). If they are truly uncalled, remove just those two function definitions (and any now-orphaned imports).
2. If they *are* still called (e.g., by `routes/chat.py` or other modules outside the reviewed file set), update the module header to accurately scope what Phase 3 migrated, rather than claiming "all queue/instance/roots logic" moved.
3. Do **not** remove `_active_project_setting`, `ENV_FILE_PATH`, `CORE_REPO_ROOT`, or `read_dashboard_settings`—these are shared by `get_second_brain_dir`, `claude_defaults`, and the subprocess clients.

Benefits:
Resolves the specific contradiction between the header's blanket claim and the code, without risking breakage of the shared path-resolution and settings-reading infrastructure that multiple live features depend on.

### AC-2 · Private helper imported across module boundary in chat route
Strength: Strong
Files: routes/chat.py, chat_sessions.py

Problem:
The `api_chat_template_save` route in `routes/chat.py` directly imports `_write_session` from `chat_sessions`. In Python, a leading underscore signals a private, module-internal helper, and importing it from a separate Flask route module means the route is reaching into an implementation detail that `chat_sessions` has not committed to exposing as a stable public API. Specifically, the route performs the logical mutation via `template_store.save_proposal` but then bypasses the standard public persistence surface to force a flush by calling the private `_write_session`. This means the route is bypassing the *persistence* step's public contract, not the logic step. Any internal refactor of `chat_sessions`'s state-management internals—renaming the helper, changing its signature, or inlining it—will break `routes/chat.py` with no compile-time or interface-level warning.

Solution:
Introduce a dedicated public method on `chat_sessions` (e.g., `save_template(session_id, payload)`) that encapsulates both the logical mutation (calling `template_store.save_proposal`) and the persistence flush (currently hidden behind `_write_session`). The route in `routes/chat.py` should call this new public method instead of importing the underscore-prefixed helper. If the write requires a specific internal sequence, that sequence lives inside `chat_sessions` and the route remains agnostic to it.

Benefits:
`routes/chat.py` depends only on the stable public contract of `chat_sessions`, so internal refactors of the session store no longer risk silently breaking the route. The public method also becomes a single, discoverable entry point for template persistence, making the module boundary explicit and testable in isolation.

### AC-3 · Inline "find-or-create" session resolution duplicated across chat routes
Strength: Worth exploring
Files: routes/chat.py, chat_sessions.py

Problem:
`api_chat_inject` in `routes/chat.py` implements a multi-step fallback to resolve a `session_id`: it tries a caller-supplied ID, then falls back to `get_active_session`, then to `start_new_conversation`. The route also manually probes both `id` and `session_id` keys in the returned dictionary (`(session or {}).get("id") or (session or {}).get("session_id")`), indicating that the return shapes of `get_active_session` and `start_new_conversation` are not uniform. This "find-or-create" logic is likely replicated (or approximated) in sibling routes such as `api_chat_active` and `api_chat_new`, each with slightly different key-checking or fallback ordering. Crucially, the route has specific error semantics: if a `requested_id` is provided but invalid, it must abort with a 404; if no ID is provided, it must try fallbacks. A simple helper that returns a session or `None` does not capture these distinct error conditions (invalid ID vs. no active session vs. creation failure), meaning the route would still need to implement the error-handling logic to distinguish these cases.

Solution:
Extract a single public helper in `chat_sessions` (e.g., `resolve_session(requested_id=None)`) that encapsulates the full fallback chain and normalises the return shape to a single, documented dictionary with a consistent `id` key. To properly handle the error semantics, this helper should raise specific exceptions (e.g., `SessionNotFound` for invalid IDs, `SessionCreationError` for fallback failures) rather than returning `None`, allowing the route to map these exceptions to the correct HTTP status codes (404 vs 500) without duplicating the fallback logic.

Benefits:
The "find-or-create" contract lives in one place, so a change to session creation or retrieval is a one-line update in `chat_sessions` rather than a multi-route edit. Routes become shorter and more readable, and the uniform return shape removes the class of bugs where a route checks the wrong key and silently gets `None`. By using exceptions for error semantics, the route logic remains clean and correctly maps failures to appropriate HTTP responses.

### AC-4 · Non-transactional reserve leaves local and server state divergent
Strength: Strong
Files: routes/chat.py, chat_sessions.py

Problem:
In `api_chat_reserve`, the route calls `internal_reserve` (the core-dashboard reservation) first and only then calls `set_reserved` to flip the local `chat_sessions` state. `internal_reserve` is a blocking call that can take a significant amount of time. If `set_reserved` raises (filesystem error, race condition, or any unhandled exception in `chat_sessions`), the local session remains `reserved: false` while the core dashboard already records `reserved: true`. The user receives a 500 response, but the reservation is live on the server side with no compensating release. The provided `internal_api_client.py` does not expose a `release` function; it only exposes `reserve(reservation_id, model, on)`. Therefore, a simple "immediate rollback" by calling a non-existent `internal_release` is not possible. The core issue is the lack of a transactional boundary between the remote blocking call and the local state update, leading to permanent inconsistency until manual intervention.

Solution:
Since `internal_api_client.py` does not provide a `release` method, the compensating pattern of calling `internal_release` is not implementable. Instead, the solution should focus on making the local state update atomic with respect to the remote call's success. One approach is to ensure `set_reserved` is idempotent and can be retried safely, but this does not solve the initial divergence. A more robust architectural fix is to modify `internal_api_client.py` to expose a `release` or `cancel` method, or to design the reservation system such that the local state is the source of truth and the remote call is made *after* local state is set, with a background task or retry mechanism to ensure the remote call eventually succeeds. Alternatively, if the remote call is the source of truth, the local state should be updated *only* after the remote call succeeds, and any failure in the local update should trigger a manual reconciliation process or a compensating remote call if available. Given the current API limitations, the most practical immediate fix is to log the divergence prominently and provide an admin endpoint to manually reconcile the state, while planning a longer-term fix to add a `release` method to the client or change the transactional order.

Benefits:
While the ideal transactional atomicity is not achievable with the current API, this approach acknowledges the limitation and provides a path to consistent state through manual reconciliation or future API enhancements. It prevents silent divergence by making the inconsistency visible and actionable, rather than assuming a rollback mechanism that does not exist.

NOTE: Flag 5 was not applied because the code for `api_chat_message` and `internal_preempt` was not provided in the context, so I could not verify the specific resource leak or state inconsistency described.
